## 1 Introduction
### 1.1 Document scope and purpose

This Attestation Rulebook defines the Digital Travel Credential (DTC) as an electronic attestation of attributes for the EUDI Wallet ecosystem. The DTC enables travellers to store and present identity and travel authorization data in their Wallet Unit for border control and travel-related use cases.

The primary objective of the DTC is to facilitate secure and privacy-preserving identity verification and travel document validation at border crossing points and during travel. The DTC is designed to complement existing physical travel documents (e.g. passports, visas) by providing a digital equivalent that supports selective disclosure, offline presentation and strong cryptographic verification.

This rulebook specifies:

* The attributes and metadata that comprise a DTC attestation
* The encoding formats that SHALL be supported for DTC attestations.
* The issuance, presentation and verification requirements for DTC attestations within the EUDI Wallet framework.
* The trust anchor mechanisms, revocation procedures and compliance requirements that apply to DTC attestations.

The DTC attestation type is intended for use by national authorities issuing travel documents and by border control agencies as Relying Parties.
